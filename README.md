# FEATURES OF APPLICATION
# Retrive the Bus Information:
Selenium is a powerful automation tool for web browsers, making it an invaluable asset for web scraping tasks. In the context of retrieving bus details from RedBus, Selenium enables the automation of the entire processâ€”from searching for buses to extracting relevant information. By interacting with web elements such as input fields and buttons, Selenium efficiently navigates the site, waits for pages to load, and extracts desired details from search results. This capability not only simplifies data collection but also enhances the accuracy and speed of retrieving essential bus travel information, creating the way for more informed decision-making in the transportation sector.

# Store data in database:
The collected bus details data was transformed into Pandas DataFrames, facilitating efficient data manipulation and analysis. Prior to this, a new database and the necessary tables were established using the MySQL connector. This integration allowed for the seamless insertion of the bus data into the corresponding tables within the database. Leveraging MySQL not only ensured structured storage of the data but also provided robust tools for access and management within the MySQL environment. This streamlined approach enhances the overall data management process, enabling users to efficiently query and analyze bus travel information.

# Web Application:
With the help of Streamlit, you can create an interactive application similar to RedBus by designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for bus routes, view available buses, and get details like departure times and prices.
